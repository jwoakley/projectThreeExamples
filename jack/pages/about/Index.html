		<h2>N.O.A.A.'s <i>10 Signs of a Warming World</i> Rebrand!</h2>
		<p>The Red Hot Flags website serves to inundate young inquisitive minds with the 10 signs of a Warming World according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.) in an easy, fun, accessible manner.<br>
		<br>
		Climate Change is a rather difficult concept to understand and to see how our world is shifting under our noses. To a child, this is no less than impossible. That’s what inspired me to create this website, as for NOAA’s very gravitas, info-heavy, dot-gov was even too dense for me!<br>
		<br>
		But through the power of cute-colorful graphics and minimalist web design, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!<br>
		<br>
		There even exist a “Live” page where for a special limited-time event, viewers and users can get live lectures to learn even more! It will be live on Earth Day Weekend, Friday through Sunday, check that "Live" page for the events' time.<br>
		<br>
		Be sure to also check the "Merch" page, as there will be an assortment of goodies and merchandise to buy!</p><img src="../../img/ASSETS/logo/300ppi/1sunlogo.png">
