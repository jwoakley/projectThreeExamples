		<h5>Climate Change is just too much. There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless.<br>
		<br>
		We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?<br>

		<b>Can YOU Fix Climate Change?</b><br>
		<!-- In case you missed - <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiw6_JakZFc<br> --></p>
		<h5>Never before in human history have we been richer, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them.<br>
		<br>
		So why don’t we just like… prevent all of that? Well, it’s complicated.</h5>

		<h5>"The planet we call home continues to nurture life and inspire wonder. Our environment works hard to sustain us, which calls for us to return the favor. Today’s video Doodle shows a variety of trees being planted within natural habitats, one of the many ways we can do our part to keep our Earth healthy for future generations."</h5>

		<p>SUN (April 24) - 12pm -<br>
		<b>We WILL Fix Climate Change!</b><br></p>
		<h5>Our home is burning. Rapid climate change is destabilizing our world. It seems our emissions will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization.<br>
		<br>
		While scientists, activists and much of the younger generation urge action, it appears most politicians are not committed to do anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change. It seems humanity can’t overcome its greed and obsession with short term profit and personal gain to save itself.<br>
		<br>
		And so for many the future looks grim and hopeless. Young people feel particularly anxious and depressed. Instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world. It’s an age of doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do.<br>
		<br>
		But that’s not true. You are not doomed. Humanity is not doomed.</h5><!-- In case you missed - <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxgMdjyw8uw<br> -->
