# Project 3 - Keenan
The Red Hot Flags website serves to inundate young inquisitive minds with the 10 signs of a Warming World according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (N.O.A.A.) in an easy, fun, accessible manner. Climate Change is a rather difficult concept to understand and to see how our world is shifting under our noses. To a child, this is no less than impossible. That’s what inspired me to create this website, as for NOAA’s very gravitas, info-heavy, dot-gov was even too dense for me! But through the power of cute-colorful graphics and minimalist web design, anything is possible! 

There even exist a “Live” page where for a special limited-time event, viewers and users can get live lectures to learn even more! It will be live on Earth Day Weekend, Friday through Sunday, check the pages for the event’s time. Be sure to also check the Merch page, as there will be an assortment of goodies and merchandise to buy!

# Technical Side
I was responsible for the rebrand of RED HOT FLAGS: logo, fonts, colors, patterns, etc., for NOAA's "10 signs of a Warming World" webpage.I conducted research, collected inspiration, copy writed, wireframed, and built the site. The final site is responsive and consist of original visual assets developed using Creative Cloud programs, live copy, and dynamic web features such as hover effects, transitions, and CSS animations. Additionally I created mock-ups for merchandise and linked a livestream for further educational purposes.
