# social justice festival

# project overview

The purpose of my project is to create a hypothetical festival that raises awareness about (East) Asian American representation in pop culture by making an interactive promotional website with the new design/coding skills that I've gained. Through my experience as an Asian American myself, I've seen the importance of having our voices in spaces as influential as music, film, and art. I wanted to put pieces of my intersecting interests and identities into this project to gain excitement and start conversations about the importance of this representation. The festival, “Dynasty,” aims to create a fun yet safe space for all people–not just East Asians–to come engage in, learn about, and show appreciation for East Asian culture and the trailblazers who are paving the way for future generations in their industries. 

Pop culture centered industries such as music, film, and art have grown astronomically since the 20th century. Nowadays, they have a strong influence on how society sees and therefore treats certain populations, especially with the rise of social media. The Asian community has historically been misrepresented in these spaces due to the way they’ve been villainized, sexualized, or flat-out ignored. While these realms are oftentimes dominated by Eurocentric, white ideas, Asians have always stayed resilient and worked hard to get to where they are in the present day. Dynasty, which acknowledges all of this information, runs from May 28th through May 30th in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, CA. Not only is the location a beautiful outdoor space, but it also connects to the strong ties that Asian Americans have in the Bay Area/Northern California. Dynasty features workshops, an art installation, cooking curriculum, guest speakers, a healing space, and music festival that all are in partnership with "Cut Fruit Collective," a SF/Bay Area grassroots non-profit that supports AAPI communities through art, and publishing, and shared love of food. Overall, all aspects of the festival, whether that be the design choices or events, aim to circle back to the celebration of Asian-American success while also educating audiences on the historical background of these topics.

# technical overview

The current status of the website is finished. The website utilizes HTML and CSS on its three pages: a home page ("HOME"), a page highlighting the festival's events ("EVENTS"), and a page for merchandise and ticket sales ("SHOP"). The "SHOP" page is the most responsive for smaller screens using media queries.

There are hover effects on the navigation bar as well as on the "learn more" buttons on the EVENTS page. The Dynasty logo, stickers, and overall branding materials were all made in Adobe Illustrator. The mockups for merchandise and edits on photos were done in Adobe Photoshop.

After researching, I first started brainstorming ideas for visuals. I made a moodboard of the ideal festivalgoers and branding inspirations. I then made potential logo variations and chose colors and fonts (the latter of which I ended up changing in the final version.)

After brainstorming, I wireframed the website in Adobe XD to get a general feel for what the website would look like. There is mostly placeholder text and fillers here that were replaced in the final.
