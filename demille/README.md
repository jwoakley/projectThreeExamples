# DemilleTaylor_ProjectThree: Social Justice Festival

 ## Project Overview

Official statement/description of the festival: "The People's Block Party is a three-day festival dedicated to service and celebrating culture. Our three-day lineup consists of panels, workshops, food, art, live music, and health services. Join us in the true spirit of the Black Panther Party's dedication to education, safety, health, and wellness."

This repository is the "official website" of my conceptual festival based on a cause that I support greatly. The first thing I did for this project was brainstorm causes that I could build a three day festival around with related programming and activities. Additionally, I wanted to align with a cause that I could build a cohesive and full brand identity around.

For my festival, I'm choosing to support the endeavors of the People's Programs organization based in Oakland, CA. People's Programs is not a direct successor of the Black Panther Party, however they've built on the Panther's foundation with their free breakfast program, mobile clinics, and legal & bail support. My festival is called the "People's Block Party" and aesthetically, is based on the Black Panther Party. For my brand identity, I chose to emulate the art style of Emory Douglas, the former Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party. Douglas designed all official BPP publications: pamphlets, newpapers, flyers, leaflets, etc.  My color palette consists of bright neon hues, bold "printing press" style typography, and texture. As for the logistics for the festival, I chose Lake Merritt as the location, as an ode to Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale's founding of the party while attending Merritt College. My programming includes mobile clinics from opening and closing each day of the festival, (no wristband/admission required), panels and activities featuring former Panthers, recycling drives and many different Black vendors. The festival concert finale will include Bay Area born & raised musicians En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Sheila E., and Carlos Santana. Our final headliner will be the legendary Stevie Wonder.

## Technical Overview 

I designed my brand identity toolkit, "official" festival graphics, and merch items in Adobe Illustrator and mockups were created in Photoshop. 
    
This site is done with HTML and CSS, and created as a GitHub repository. For my home page, I incorporated responsive sizing utilizing flexboxes, viewports, and key frames.
    
With this project, I did more in-depth development and wireframing in Adobe XD to have a clear direction of what I wanted my site to looks like.
