# Project 3: Social Justice Festival
### by Anna Pham
## Project overview
Asian Mind Care is an organization that mainly focuses on the mental health of Asian Americans and addressing the stigma that affects them due to family, culture, and community. 

Asian Mind Care hosts a 3-day festival with multiple events over 3 days, which include: 
<ol>
<li>Opening Ceremony and Panel Discussion</li>
<li>Storytelling, Art Exhibition and Workshops</li> 
<li>Yoga, Community Fair, and Closing Remarks</li>
</ol>

The target audience for the festival is mainly young Asian Americans, but older Asian Americans and non-Asian audiences are welcome too. 

The organization that the money from the Asian Mind Care festival support is The Child Mind Institute. It was founded in 2009 by Dr. Harold Koplewiscz to increase access to diagnosis and treatment for children with mental health and learning challenges after he experienced poor mental health treatment as a child. 

Asian Mind Care’s website consists of 5 pages: Home, About, Event, Merchandise, and Contact. The main color for the Asian mental health theme is blue and green, which are used as gradient and solid colors. Each page has a big stock image in the header and a couple of graphic images (in solid green and blue) in the body to represent the message. The logo was designed with 2 colors, a white logo on a gradient background and a gradient logo on a white background. The main fonts for the website are Adobe Fonts: FinalSix (for the logo as well as for menu navigation and footer), BigCity Grotesque Pro (for the heading), and Europa-light (for the body paragraph). 

## Technical overview
The general layout of the website was executed in Adobe XD for high-fidelity wireframes. The logo and graphic images were executed in Adobe Illustrator.
