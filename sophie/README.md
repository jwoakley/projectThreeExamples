# Project 1: Social Justice Festival 
By Sophie Reichert 

# Project overview 
This website encompasses a fictional Social Justice Festival. The topic I chose is consent education, as well as sex education, as a facet of this theme. My audience are young females; specifically those who are either high school or college age. I also wanted to cater towards survivors at this event in paticular and offer content that is empowering and not triggering. I felt this topic was necessary to adress because most education around sexual assault isreactive rather than proactive. Generally, I feel that although this reactive support is extremely helpful, it is also helpful to teach boundaries - both in a sexual and non-sexual manner. Given that many people do not receive sex education or have access to the condoms, dental dams, birth control, etc, I think this festival will not only provide the tools for safe sex – but also raise awareness around this lack of education.

The kickoff event will take place on a Friday, and will be the main educational talk. It will involve a comprehensive talk and activities that pertain to consent education – and that will empower listeners to teach the information to those in their communities. The events on the second day will be speakers. These speakers will include those who have worked in sexual assault prevention and consent education, in the bay area. The closing events will be 2 crafting events. One will be targeted to the larger community. It will involve creating safe sex bags to distribute through the community. These goody bags will include pregnancy tests, plan b, condoms, dental dams, and other first aid supplies. The second crafting event will a crochet event. Crochet is proven to be a helpful de-stressing agent. I also want to facilitate a discussion around the idea that clothing or other aspects may deem a person more prone to assault (a false claim) while crocheting clothing. It will be a place also for survivors to share stories.
