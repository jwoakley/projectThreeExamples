    <p> 
      We are an organization that seeks to educate young people, specifically those who are 
      high school and college students about consent. We want to cultivate a sex postivite space
      as often many, due to family, or other factors, are not exposed to this sort of education. 
      <br> <br> 
      Our organization, Cultivating Consent, feels strongly that the education system has failed young 
      people in its lack of comprehensive sex ed, as well as reactive centered consent education. We want to 
      encourage proactive education, and the normalization of askingf or consent in all situations, not just sexual.
      We encouarge particpants to share the information and tools they learn with their community. 
      Please feel free to use the email below if you need additional help organizing.
